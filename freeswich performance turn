Recommended SIP settings

    Turn off every module you don't need that is not also needed by FreeSWITCH
    Turn presence off in the profiles
    libsofia only handles 1 thread per profile, so if that is your bottle neck use more profiles
    Reports of running more than a single instance of FreeSWITCH has helped.
    Disable console logging when not needed - loglevel
